# Supported Languages

We keep a list of languages supported by code suggestions in `code_suggestions_config.json` in the root of the project.

This list is used by the language server to decide whether to provide code suggestions for the active file.

This file is also [consumed by the VS Code Extension](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/blob/main/docs/developer/code-suggestions-supported-languages.md).
